# CareerMitra

CareerMitra is an AI-driven platform designed to help students discover their educational interests and guide them towards the right branch of education. By leveraging engaging methods such as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and interactive games, CareerMitra collects data to analyze a student's preferences and inclinations. The AI model then predicts the studentâ€™s trending interests and provides a personalized roadmap to achieve success in their chosen field.

## Features

- **Interactive Assessments**: Students answer MCQs and play educational games tailored to identify their interests.
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Uses an advanced AI model to predict the student's trending education branch based on collected data.
- **Personalized Roadmaps**: After selecting a preferred branch, the platform provides a detailed roadmap to achieve success, starting from the basics.
- **Gamification**: Engages students through games that make the assessment process fun and intuitive.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Easy-to-use interface for students to track their progress and view their recommendations.

## How It Works

1. **Assessment Phase**:
    - Students complete a series of MCQs and interactive games.
    - Data is collected and securely processed by the system.

2. **Prediction Phase**:
    - The AI model analyzes the data and predicts the educational branch the student is most inclined towards.

3. **Roadmap Generation**:
    - Based on the selected branch, CareerMitra provides a personalized step-by-step roadmap, including resources, skills to acquire, and milestones to achieve.
